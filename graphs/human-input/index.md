# Human input for agent workflows

Supported in ADKPython v2.0.0

Being able to request human input for data input, decision verification, or action permission is an important part of many agent-powered workflows. Graph-based workflows in ADK can include human in the loop (HITL) nodes specifically built for obtaining input from humans as part of a workflow. These nodes do not require artificial intelligence (AI) models to run, which can make the input process more predictable and reliable.

## Get started

You can implement a human input node in a graph using the ***RequestInput*** class and a text prompt for the user. The following code example shows how to add a human input node to an Workflow graph:

```python
from google.adk.events import RequestInput
from google.adk import Workflow

def step1(): # Human input step
  yield RequestInput(message="Enter a number:")

def step2(node_input):
  return node_input * 2

root_agent = Workflow(
    name="root_agent",
    edges=[('START', step1, step2)],
)
```

In this code example, `step1` pauses the execution of the agent until the system receives an input from a user. Once the system receives input from the user, that input is passed to the next node.

## Configuration options

Human input nodes can use the ***RequestInput*** class with the following configuration options:

- **`message`:** Text provided to the user to explain the human input request.
- **`payload`:** Structured data to be used as part of the human input request.
- **`response_schema`:** A data structure the human response must conform to.

Note: Response schema input limitations

For the **response_schema** setting, the ***RequestInput*** class does not automatically reformat human responses to fit a specified data structure. The human response must be provided in the specified format. For a better user experience, consider providing a user interface to collect structured data or use an Agent node to conform unstructured data to the format required.

## Human input examples

The following code examples demonstrate more detailed human input requests, including the use of ***message***, ***payload*** and ***response schema*** parameters.

### Request input with response schema

The following code sample shows how to construct a ***RequestInput*** object in a workflow node, including a ***response schema***:

```python
async def initial_prompt(ctx: Context):
   """Ask the user for itinerary information"""
   input_message = """
       This is an interactive concierge workflow tasked with making you a great
       itinerary for you in your city of choice. If you give some details about
       yourself or what you are generally looking for I can better personalize
       your itinerary.
       For example, input your:
           City (Required),
           Age,
           Hobby,
           Example of attraction you liked
   """
   yield RequestInput(message=input_message, response_schema=str)
```

### Request input with data payload

The following code sample shows how to construct a ***RequestInput*** object in a workflow node, including a ***payload*** and ***response schema***. In this example, the `ActivitiesList` is expected to be completed by an agent node that composes a list of activities, and the `get_user_feedback()` node requests feedback for the user.

```python
class ActivitiesList(BaseModel):
   """Itinerary should be a list of dictionaries for each activity. Each
   activity has a name and a description"""
   itinerary: List[Dict[str, str]]

class UserFeedback(BaseModel):
   """Expected response structure from the user."""
   user_response: str

async def get_user_feedback(node_input: ActivitiesList):
   """
   Retrieves the user's thoughts on the agents initial itinerary in order to
   either expand on, change the list, or exit the loop
   """
   message = (
       f"""
       Here is your recommended base itinerary:\n{node_input}\n\n
       Which of these items appeal to you (if any)?
       """
   )

   yield RequestInput(
       message=message,
       payload=node_input,
        response_schema=UserFeedback,
   )
```
