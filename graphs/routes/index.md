# Build graph routes for agent workflows

Supported in ADKPython v2.0.0

Graph-based workflows in ADK define agent logic as a graph of execution nodes and edges, allowing you to build more reliable processes that combine artificial intelligence (AI) reasoning and code logic. These workflows allow you to create logical routes of execution nodes that can encapsulate code functions, AI-powered agents, Tools, and human input. By explicitly mapping out routing logic, this approach allows you to define a specific, step-wise process workflow in code, providing improved precision and reliability over purely prompt-based agents.

```python
root_agent = Workflow(
  name="routing_workflow",
  edges=[
    ("START", process_message, router),
    (router,
      {
        "output-1": response_1,
        "output-2": response_2,
        "output-3": response_3,
      },
    ),
  ],
)
```

The advantage of using a graph-based agent workflow is the significant increase in control, predictability, and reliability over prompt-based agents. By defining the overall process workflow in code, you gain more control over how tasks are routed and executed. This structured node definition improves the predictability of agents and enhances reliability for complex tasks that require defined steps and process management.

Get started with graph-based workflows in ADK by checking out [Graph-based agent workflows](/graphs/).

## Nodes

A graph is composed of execution nodes. These *nodes* can be ***Agents***, ADK ***Tools***, human input tasks, or code functions you write. Nodes can take inputs from previously executed nodes, and emit data through ***Event*** objects. The following shows a simple ***FunctionNode*** that handles text inputs and sends a text output:

```python
from google.adk import Event

def my_function_node(node_input: str):
    input_text_modified = node_input.upper()
    return Event(output=input_text_modified)
```

For more information about transferring data between nodes, see . [Data handling for agent workflows](/graphs/data-handling/).

## Workflow graphs syntax

You define a graph by creating an ***edges*** array, which defines a logical execution path of *nodes* and conditions to be followed. This section provides an overview of graph syntax in an ***edges*** array. The following code example shows a basic workflow with two nodes to be executed in order:

```python
from google.adk import Workflow

root_agent = Workflow(
    name="sequential_workflow",
    edges=[("START", task_A_node, task_B_node)],
)
```

Caution: Workflows and agent limitations

You can add ***Agents***, or ***LlmAgents***, to graph-based workflows, however they must be set to a task or single-turn mode. For more information about agent modes, see [Build collaborative agent teams](/workflows/collaboration/#mode-configuration-and-behaviors).

### Route sequences

The ***edges*** array executes nodes based on the order or nodes presented in the array, starting with the first row and proceeding through the subsequent rows until execution is complete. The first row of the ***edges*** array uses the ***START*** keyword to indicate the beginning of a graph execution, with each listed node executed in sequence, as shown in the following code snippets:

```python
edges=[("START", task_A_node)]  # single node run
edges=[("START",
        task_A_node,
        task_B_node,
        task_C_node)]           # 3 nodes run in order
```

You can also use ***START*** more than once to initiate parallel tasks at the beginning of a workflow graph, as shown in the following code snippet:

```python
edges=[
    ("START", parallel_task_A),
    ("START", parallel_task_B),
    ("START", parallel_task_C),
]
```

Caution: Limitations on parallel nodes

Not all workflow nodes or subagents can be run in parallel. In particular, you cannot run multiple interactive chat sessions within the same agent session.

### Route branches and conditional execution

The subsequent rows of the ***edges*** arrays after the START keyword define additional execution logic for nodes. For branching paths, which is how you create a conditional node, you define a node, usually a ***FunctionNode***, that outputs an Event with a specific ***route*** value. In the edges graph, you then define the conditional execution logic by mapping these route values to target nodes, as shown in the following code example:

```python
def router(node_input: str):
    """Route to task B or C based on node_input."""
    if condition(node_input):
        return Event(route="RUN_TASK_C")
    return Event(route="RUN_TASK_B")

task_B_node = Agent(name="task_B_agent") # An agent to execute node B

def task_C_node(node_input: str):
    """A FunctionNode to execute node C."""
    return Event(output="Task C completed")

root_agent = Workflow(
    name="routing_workflow",
    edges=[
        ("START", task_A_node, router),
        (router,
          {
            # "route value": node_to_run
            "RUN_TASK_B": task_B_node,
            "RUN_TASK_C": task_C_node,
          },
        ),
    ],
)
```

## Parallel tasks: fan out and join paths

You can create graphs that split execution across multiple, parallel nodes, and typically you need to assemble the output of each node for further processing. This task execution pattern has two stages. The workflow first fans out when it starts multiple parallel tasks, and then it re-joins those paths when those those tasks are completed before proceeding to the next step.

You accomplish the join step by using a ***JoinNode*** object, which waits for each parallel task to complete and then passes the collection of outputs from these nodes to the next node.

**Figure 2.** The output of parallel task nodes can be assembled using a JoinNode object.

The following code snippet shows how to start three parallel tasks from ***START*** and use a basic ***JoinNode*** object to join their outputs before running the final task:

```python
​​from google.adk.workflow import JoinNode

my_join_node = JoinNode(name="my_join_node")

edges=[
    ("START", parallel_task_A, my_join_node),
    ("START", parallel_task_B, my_join_node),
    ("START", parallel_task_C, my_join_node),
    (my_join_node, final_task_D),
]
```

Caution: Stuck JoinNode from incomplete nodes

The ***JoinNode*** object proceeds only after all its upstream nodes have provided an Event output. If one of the upstream nodes fails to provide output, the JoinNode is stuck and workflow execution stops. Make sure to include failsafe output from any node that outputs to a ***JoinNode***.

## Nested workflows

When building more complex workflows, you may want to encapsulate the functionality for specific tasks into reusable workflows. One or more ***Workflow*** objects can be used as a node within the graph of another workflow agent to accomplish this goal.

**Figure 3.** Nested ***Workflows*** as nodes inside a parent ***Workflow***.

The following code snippet shows how to implement a workflow agent with two nested more ***Workflow*** objects (workflow_B, workflow_C) as nodes in the graph:

```python
from google.adk import Workflow

root_agent = Workflow(
    name="parent_workflow",
    edges=[
       ("START", task_A1, router),
       (router, {
            "RUN_WORKFLOW_B": workflow_B,
            "RUN_WORKFLOW_C": workflow_C,
            },
       ),
    ],
)
```

### Nested workflow data output

Output for nested Workflow objects works slightly differently from individual nodes. When the nested workflow completes one of its nodes, it transmits data to the next node in the nested workflow's graph *and* the system bubbles up the Event for that node to the parent workflow for process traceability. When the nested workflow completes the last node in its process, the parent node extracts data from the final leaf nodes and emits it as the output of the nested workflow.
